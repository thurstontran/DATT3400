SUMMARY:
This project is meant to simulate what we know of the solar system with celestial bodies such as the planets, asteroids, and stars as well as starships that roam around. These elements are meant to interact with each other, by either colliding and bouncing, or having an object be removed on collision. The planets are rotating around the Sun at random speeds with the asteroids and starships randomly moving around the sketch which acts as outer space or the galaxy. I was able to create the animations of the stars, planets, and asteroids fairly easily but had difficulties with adding collision detection onto the objects, particularly with the asteroids. After some feedback and researching online, I found resources that helped with the collision and managed to have a method to detect the collision for the asteroids.
